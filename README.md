# 🏛️ CivicStream

**A DAG-based workflow automation platform for government processes**

CivicStream empowers government organizations to model, execute, and optimize citizen-facing processes using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Built with modern microservices architecture, it provides transparency, efficiency, and accountability in government operations.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **📊 DAG-based Workflow Engine** - Model complex government processes as directed acyclic graphs
- **⚡ Performance Monitoring** - Real-time bottleneck detection and citizen wait time analysis
- **🔄 Step-by-Step Execution** - Independent, reusable workflow components following DRY principles
- **🎯 Conditional Routing** - Smart decision-making based on citizen data and context
- **✅ Approval Workflows** - Built-in approval processes with multiple approver types
- **🔗 External Integrations** - Connect with existing government systems and services
- **🔒 Blockchain Integration** - Immutable process records (planned)

### Step Types
- **ActionStep** - Execute specific business logic
- **ConditionalStep** - Route based on conditions
- **ApprovalStep** - Human approval with configurable approvers
- **IntegrationStep** - External service calls
- **TerminalStep** - Workflow completion with status

### Performance Analytics
- **📈 Real-time Metrics** - Execution times, success rates, error tracking
- **🎯 Bottleneck Detection** - Identify delays in approval processes and external services
- **📊 Citizen Wait Time Analysis** - Track time between workflow steps
- **💡 Optimization Suggestions** - AI-powered recommendations for process improvement

## 🔄 Workflow Definition Example

```python
from app.workflows.base import ActionStep, ConditionalStep, TerminalStep
from app.workflows.workflow import Workflow

# Create workflow
workflow = Workflow(
    workflow_id="simple_approval",
    name="Simple Approval Process"
)

# Define steps
validate = ActionStep("validate", "Validate Request", validate_request)
approve = ApprovalStep("approve", "Manager Approval", ["manager"])
success = TerminalStep("success", "Approved", "SUCCESS")
rejected = TerminalStep("rejected", "Rejected", "REJECTED")

# Define flow
validate >> approve
approve.when(is_approved) >> success
approve.when(is_rejected) >> rejected

# Add to workflow
workflow.add_steps([validate, approve, success, rejected])
workflow.set_start(validate)
```
