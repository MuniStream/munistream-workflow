# CivicStream Project Context

## Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-07-10)

### Project Overview
CivicStream is a DAG-based workflow automation platform for government services, starting with building permit workflows. The system has:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with MongoDB, complete authentication system with JWT tokens
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Material-UI v7, fully containerized
- **Repositories**: 
  - Backend: https://github.com/paw-ml/civicstream-workflow
  - Frontend: https://github.com/paw-ml/civicstream-admin-frontend

### Completed Features
1. âœ… Complete authentication system with 5 roles and 12 permissions
2. âœ… Document verification system with AI analysis
3. âœ… Workflow visualization with Mermaid.js
4. âœ… Admin inbox for approvals and reviews
5. âœ… Real MongoDB persistence (no mock data)
6. âœ… Frontend fully containerized and pushed to GitHub

### GitHub Projects (Kanban Boards)
- **Project #1**: CivicStream Frontend Development (6 issues in Todo)
- **Project #2**: CivicStream Backend Development (5 issues in Todo)

### Current Task
Was creating GitHub issues for the kanban boards. Encountered shell environment error. Still need to create:
- Frontend Issue #9: ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Create Mobile-Responsive Views
- Frontend Issue #10: ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Add Bulk Operations

### Tomorrow's Priorities
1. ðŸ”´ HIGH: Create Citizen Instance Tracking System (Frontend Issue #1, Backend Issue #2)
2. ðŸ”´ HIGH: Add Real-time Notifications & WebSocket Integration (Frontend Issue #2, Backend Issue #1)
3. ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Create User Management Interface (Frontend Issue #3)

### Development Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd /Users/paw/Projects/CivicStream/backend
docker-compose up

# Frontend
cd /Users/paw/Projects/CivicStream/civicstream-admin-frontend
docker-compose up

# Access
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend API: http://localhost:8000
API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Test Users
- admin / admin123 (Admin role - all permissions)
- manager / manager123 (Manager role)
- reviewer / reviewer123 (Reviewer role)
- approver / approver123 (Approver role)
- viewer / viewer123 (Viewer role)

### Key Technical Decisions
- Separate repositories for frontend and backend
- Docker containers for both services
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- MongoDB with Beanie ODM
- React Query for data fetching
- Material-UI v7 for components
- Mermaid.js for workflow visualization

### Workflow Creation Pattern
**IMPORTANT**: Workflows in CivicStream are created programmatically in Python code, NOT through API calls. The proper workflow creation process is:

1. **Define workflows in Python** using the Airflow-inspired syntax in `/app/workflows/examples/`
2. **Auto-register** them through the registry system (`/app/workflows/registry.py`)
3. **Persist to database** via the workflow service layer
4. **Access via API** for runtime operations (instances, execution, monitoring)

Example workflow creation:
```python
def create_my_workflow() -> Workflow:
    workflow = Workflow("my_workflow_id", "My Workflow", "Description")
    
    step_a = ActionStep("step_a", "First Step", action=my_function)
    step_b = ApprovalStep("step_b", "Approval", approvers=["manager"])
    
    step_a >> step_b  # Define flow
    
    workflow.add_step(step_a)
    workflow.add_step(step_b)
    workflow.set_start(step_a)
    
    return workflow
```

The API endpoints are for managing workflow instances and execution, not for creating new workflow definitions.

### Development Standards
**IMPORTANT**: Never cut corners by adding fake, mock, or test data to make features appear to work. Always fix the underlying issues properly:

1. **No Mock Data** - Don't create fake database entries or API responses to simulate functionality
2. **No Shortcuts** - Don't add temporary hacks or workarounds that bypass the proper architecture
3. **Fix Root Causes** - Always identify and resolve the actual underlying problems
4. **Proper Integration** - Ensure all components work together as designed, not through artificial connections

Example: If instance tracking shows 0% progress, don't add fake step data - instead fix the workflow-to-database synchronization issue.

### Resume Instructions
To continue after restart, say:
"Continue working on the CivicStream project. We were adding the remaining issues to the kanban boards. Frontend issues 9 and 10 still need to be created for Mobile-Responsive Views and Bulk Operations."
